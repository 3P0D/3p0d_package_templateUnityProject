Here is THE nomenclature for your animations:


nameName@attack_01


You want to ALWAYS have your animations following this nomenclature.
It is Unity's standard animation naming convention, so just stick with it please.


Examples:
> player@readyToAttack_2H
> dragonKing@defeated
> item@hovering_loop
