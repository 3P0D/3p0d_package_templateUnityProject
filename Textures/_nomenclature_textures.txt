Here is a proposition of nomenclature for your textures:


tex_target_nameName_var_00_a_textureType


The basic texture types you might use in your projects: 
> albedo, normalMap, heightMap, ambientOcclusion, metalness, roughness/smoothness, alpha

Some more specific maps you might use in your projects:
> curvature, cavity, thickness, transluency, displacement, ...

You can use abreviations for you maps, such as AO, NM, SMTH, MTL...


Examples:
> tex_humanMage_rank1_body_albedo
> tex_humanMage_rank1_body_normalmap
> tex_bg_flowers_marguerites_pack01_alpha
