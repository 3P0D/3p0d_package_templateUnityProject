Here is a proposition of nomenclature for your scenes:


sc_x_nameName


You want to have the place of your scene in the game scene hierarchy to make it easier for you and your team to work. 
I use X as a tag for unused, debug or temporary scenes.


Examples:
> sc_0_startMenu
> sc_1_game
> sc_X_debug_createPrefabs_3P0D
