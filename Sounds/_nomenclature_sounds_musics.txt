Here is a proposition of nomenclature for your music files:


snd_msc_target_nameNamevar_00_a


The target would be the part of the game where the music would be used. Can be useful when it plays in a specific situation such as a boss fight theme, or a zone, or an event incoming...


Examples:
> snd_msc_bossFight_intro
> snd_msc_bossFight_phase3_loop
> snd_msc_bg_forest_enchantedSpring_loop_A
