Here is a proposition of nomenclature for your voice over files:


snd_vc_target_nameName_event_var_a_0000


The numbers here is the order of the line if multiple ones has to be played one after ther other in a dialog voice over. 
The letter here would be more of a variations of different possible voices, like if you had 5 different greetings for a npc.


Examples:
> snd_vc_npc_humanArchmage_greetings_A
> snd_vc_enemy_orcWarlock_defeated_0002
> snd_vc_boss_dragonKing_quest026_encounter_0006
